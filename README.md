# CubicSystem
### What is this?
It's a WIP game project

### When will it be finished?
Never.

### What is it about?
It's about -_classified information_-. For now I'm just following [learnopengl.com](http://www.learnopengl.com) tutorials

### How can I compile it and mess around just like you do?
You need the following libraries into your path, or in the same folder with the program executable:
- `glew32.lib`
- `glfw3.lib`
- `SOIL.lib`

You also do need the following includes:
- `GL/glew.h`
- `GLFW/glfw3.h`
- `GLM`
- `SOIL.h`

### OK thanks
No.
